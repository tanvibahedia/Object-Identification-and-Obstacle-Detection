# Object-Identification-and-Obstacle-Detection
The idea here is to design the systems which will be more efficient for visually impaired people. 
1. Object Detection:
The object detection system will help in avoiding any obstacle in the path for the user. The object 
detection system will also work as obstacle avoidance and guidance system for the visually 
impaired.
2. Object Identification:
The object identification system will help the visually impaired not only detect some object in a 
room but also realize and know what the object is in front of them.
